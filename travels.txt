Not to brag, but I have traveled to over 30 countries and 6 continents.
My favorite countries to visit were Italy, Australia, Israel, and France.
Perhaps my favorite place in the world is Bayeux, France.
However, the most fun trip that I took was an RV trip from Colorado Springs, CO to Lake Louise, Canada (and back).
